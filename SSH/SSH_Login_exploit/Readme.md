## ssh_exploit.py
### **Description**

This script is used to bruteforce logins of a ssh server using metasploit.
A TCP connection is made with each one of the discovered hosts on port 22 (default ssh port), that has to be made 
before using this file, actually it is not sure that the port 22 runs a ssh service, because the network administrator
may change the ssh service to another port for security concerns, in order to be sure the nmap lib should
have been used because the ouput of the scan tells us the service the port is running on. Anyway most
times port 22's running a ssh service.

If a target is found (with port 22 opened) a rc file is created to be used with metasploit. RC files are
configuration files to automate task at a program or to change settings. In this case we use it automate
tasks with metasploit.

There two main files the users file and the passwords file. For each username each password will be tried,
and it goes one until the last username is reached. 

I did not find a graceful way to stop the program when the right username and password were found, for this reason the terminal running te script can be minimixed and put at the corner of the screen while the user do other work, still the user has to pay attention to
the results of terminal. 

If the user does not pay attention to it, nothing bad will happen, but the script
will go one till the last username is reached, even if the right username and password were found.

If the script is stopped with ctrl+c it stops but an error will be given and a new terminal has to be
opened in order to work properly, even if the script is not stopped and it runs till the end the same
issue will happen.

To get the current establish connection if the username/password of the ssh server is found type :
session -i <session number> on the msfconsole
