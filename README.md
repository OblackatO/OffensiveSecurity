# Offensive Security

This repository contains scripts in the offensive security field written when I had a intermidiate level in computer security 
and in python. 

I would have written the great majority of them differently if it was today.
Each file has usually a description of what it does, others have names that are self explanatory.

Same file were written in python2.7, but the majority were written in python3 =<
This repository was not updated for a while, nor it will be soon, as I'm currently working more on the defensive side.

Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other members of the community. We do not  
allow anyone to use our platform for exploit delivery, such as using GitHub as a means to deliver  malicious executables, or as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service  attacks  or managing command and control servers.

Thus, this repository is meant to share my interest in offensive security, and some related areas(such as counter intelligence), but most
importantly it has an educational value and provides a benefit to the security community.
