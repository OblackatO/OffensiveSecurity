# Offensive Security

This repository contains scripts related to offensive security field written when I had an intermidiate level in computer security and in python. 

I would have written the great majority of them differently if it was today.
Each file has usually a description of what it does, others have names that are self explanatory.

Some code was written in python2.7, but the majority of it was written in python3.  

## **Disclaimer**   
I am not, nor will I ever be responsible for what you decide to do with the code found on the repository. 
It is illegal to use it for malicious purposes, such as cyber attacks. 

*According to github legal rules, such repositories are allowed, refer to the community guidelines for more details :*  
 
```    
"Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other members of the community. We do not      
allow anyone to use our platform for exploit delivery, such as using GitHub as a means to deliver  
malicious executables, or  as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks     
or managing command and control servers. Note, however, that we do not prohibit the posting of source     
code which could be used to develop malware or exploits, as the  publication and distribution of such     
source code has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community."    
```  
 
Thus, this repository is meant to share my interest in offensive security, and some related areas(such as counter intelligence), but most importantly it has an educational value and provides a benefit to the security community.
